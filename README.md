Integrated Healthcare Platform for Timely Disease Surveillance and Medical
Camp Management
This project aims to develop a web-based platform tailored for medical
professionals to facilitate the organization of medical camps in areas lacking
healthcare infrastructure and to stay informed about disease outbreaks. The
platform features a user-friendly interface with integrated functionalities for
searching localities, accessing hospital data, setting up disease alerts, and
managing user profiles. Leveraging Google Maps API, medical professionals can
efficiently identify areas with inadequate healthcare facilities based on the
number of hospitals available. Additionally, the platform incorporates real-time
disease surveillance by issuing alerts to medical professionals in the event of a
sudden spike in specific diseases by collecting the data from different hospitals.
User registration and profile management functionalities ensure personalized
experiences, while a notification system delivers timely alerts via email.
Emphasis is placed on data privacy and security compliance, with robust
measures implemented to safeguard user information. Through rigorous
testing, feedback collection, and continuous maintenance, the platform aims to
provide a reliable and valuable tool for medical professionals to optimize their
outreach efforts and contribute to improved healthcare access and disease
prevention in underserved areas.
